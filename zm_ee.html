                <p>ZM_EE is a text-based guide for Call of Duty: Zombies players to view before, during, and after they
                    play
                    zombies so these players can complete the main quest and learn about the zombies story line as they
                    go
                    through.
                </p>
                <p>I am currenly focusing on all of Treyarch's main title games from Call of Duty: World at War to Call
                    of
                    Duty: Black Ops 6, playing through each map that contains a main quest to take screenshots to
                    accompany
                    the text-based guide. This project is made for casual and hardcore Call of Duty: Zombies Players on
                    assisting them with the steps to complete the main quest.

            <p>This project is still a work in progress. More information will be release soon as I continue my research
                as well as developing the website.</p>

                <p>ZM_EE aids Call of Duty: Zombies fans with descriptive text and images to help players
                    complete the main quest for each map they want to play.

                    ZM_EE is a website to help quickly guide players to learn the main quest of a map. From Call of Duty
                    World at War to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. This website will have a very minimalistic look to it
                    with a very familiar color scheme of the Call of Duty: Black Ops logo. Each game will be divided and
                    each map will have its own page with a thorough step-by-step instructions on how to solve the main
                    quest and those instructions will be accompanied by images for much ease.
                </p>
                <p>This website was designed for players to learn or to get a quick refresher on how to complete the
                    quest or where to find an object while they play the game simultaneously. Navigation will be easy as
                    anchor scroll will be on every step of the map.</p>

                <p>
                This shorthand flow displays interactable features on ZM_EE. In the homescreen there will be a drop down for each game which will display each map that the game contains. Once the user selects the map, it will take them to the guide page. The guide page has a selection of steps if the user decides to skip ahead and it will take them to the section of the page that contains that step. 
                </p>

            <div class="ZMPrototype">
                <p>
                Iâ€™ve created a prototype to demonstrate what ZM_EE would look like. As presented in the shorthand flow, the user is able to view the main page and a dropdown that will display each map for each game presented. Once the user selects the map, there will be descriptive copywriting and images so the user can quickly understand. The user will be able to select which step they are on for maximum efficiency.

            <p>This project is still a work in progress. More information will be release soon as I continue my research
                as well as developing the website.</p>
